# DevOps Tech Test

The following use case might be a real-life example from one of our customers, please deliver your best possible solution. Please go through the described scenario and write a script, in one of the below languages, implementing a fix to the issue below.

For the development of the scripts you have 4 hours and are allowed to use Google and any other material as long as the work submitted was written by you.

## Use Case

- A database upgrade requires the execution of numbered SQL scripts stored in a specified folder, named such as `045.createtable.sql`
- The scripts may contain any simple SQL statement(s) to any table of your choice, e.g. `INSERT INTO testTable VALUES("045.createtable.sql");`
- There may be gaps in the SQL file name numbering and there isn't always a . (dot) after the beginning number
- The database upgrade is based on looking up the current version in the database and comparing this number to the numbers in the script names
- The table where the current db version is stored is called `versionTable`, with a single row for the version, called `version`
- If the version number from the db matches the highest number from the scripts then nothing is executed
- All scripts that contain a number higher than the current db version will be executed against the database in numerical order
- In addition, the database version table is updated after the script execution with the executed script's number
- Your script will be executed automatically via a program, and must satisfy these command line input parameters exactly in order to run:
  - `./your-script.your-lang directory-with-sql-scripts username-for-the-db db-host db-name db-password`

## Requirements

- Supported Languages (No other languages will be accepted):
  - Bash
  - Python 3
  - PHP
  - Shell
  - Ruby
  - Powershell
- You will have to use a MySQL 5.7 database

How would you implement this in order to create an automated solution to the above requirements?

Please send us your script(s) and any associated notes for our review and we will come back to you asap regarding next steps.

We are looking forward to your submission.
